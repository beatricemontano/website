		<details> <summary>Abstract</summary>
		  	 <p style="text-align:justify;"> We describe a natural experiment occasioned by an abrupt increase in the transmission range of an independent Tanzanian radio station whose broadcasts emphasize current affairs and gender equality. Some villages that formerly lay outside the catchment area of this radio station could now receive it, while nearby villages remained outside of reception range. Before the change in transmitter range in 2018, we conducted a baseline survey in both treated and untreated villages and found them to be similar in terms of prevailing social attitudes and political interest. An endline survey conducted in 2020 shows that respondents in areas that received the new radio signal were substantially more likely to listen to the station, and their levels of political interest and knowledge about domestic politics were significantly higher than their counterparts in villages that the signal could not reach. Attitude change on a range of gender issues, however, was sporadic.  </p>

		<details> <summary>Abstract</summary>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify;">  Early and forced marriage (EFM) is an increasing focus of international organizations and local non-government organizations. This study assesses the extent to which attitudes and norms related to EFM can be changed by locally tailored media campaigns. A two-hour radio drama set in rural Tanzania was presented to Tanzanian villagers as part of a placebo-controlled experiment randomized at the village level. A random sample of 1200 villagers was interviewed at baseline and invited to a presentation of the radio drama, 83% of whom attended. 95% of baseline respondents were re-interviewed two weeks later, and 97% 15 months after that. The radio drama produced sizable and statistically significant effects on attitudes and perceived norms concerning forced marriage, which was the focus of the radio drama, as well as more general attitudes about gender equality. Fifteen months later, treatment effects diminished, but we continue to see evidence of EFM-related attitude change. </p>

	<b> What women want: the public policy effect of patriarchy </b> <br>
		with Simone Paci and Chiara Superti
		<ul>
		<details> <summary>Abstract</summary>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">  Power remains predominantly male-dominated, with patriarchal norms obstructing women's participation in politics and the labor market, even in the Global North. This study argues and demonstrates how patriarchy and paternalism shape perceptions of women's aspirations, leading to contrasting ``pro-women" policies -- either empowering or paternalistic. We leverage having a daughter as a factor that enhances men's awareness of women's issues, and study its interaction with patriarchal systems. Using a novel municipal-level dataset on Italian mayors, policy outcomes, and patriarchal metrics, we find that having a daughter positively affects investments in emancipatory policies only in municipalities with low patriarchy; in high patriarchy areas, this effect diminishes or becomes negative. Instead, investments in women's safety initiatives follow the opposite trend. The effects are stronger for term-limited mayors who face fewer electoral constraints, suggesting the mechanism works through personal beliefs rather than electoral incentives. These findings underscore a policy-driven channel for the persistence of gender gaps: even when male leaders assert their support for women's interests, patriarchal norms influence how they define ``pro-women" policies. </p>		</details>

		<details> <summary>Abstract</summary>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">  Do rulings by high courts influence social attitudes and perceived norms? Evidence from outside of industrialized democracies is scarce. This paper investigates the influence of a recent Tanzanian high court decision that laws permitting marriage for girls under the age of 18 are unconstitutional. We begin by showing that just 8\% of rural Tanzanians had heard about the ruling one year after it was made. We then report the results of a lab-in-the-field experiment to test whether media reports about the court's decision influence attitudes, perceived norms, and intentions to report early marriage to authorities. We randomly assigned 1,950 respondents in rural Tanzania to hear a radio news story about the ruling or to a control condition. Respondents who heard the report were 8 percentage points more likely to reject early marriage and 5 percentage points more likely to say they would report early marriage to authorities, but no more likely to believe their rural community rejects early marriage or to volunteer to speak out publicly against early marriage. The effect of the report attenuated but did not disappear when it included the information that Tanzania's Attorney General disagreed with the court decision. We conclude that high court rulings can influence public opinion, but these effects depend on dissemination and framing by news media. </p>

		<details> <summary>Abstract</summary>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">  A growing body of work finds that entertainment-education interventions can influence attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, but few studies consider their effects on audiences' political preferences. We present results from a series of experiments conducted in Tanzania that estimate the impact of four radio dramas on how audiences prioritize protecting the environment, countering gender-based violence, reducing early forced marriage, and improving access to HIV treatment. Interviewing listeners 2-4 weeks after they were exposed to the drama, we find that three of the four dramas significantly increased listeners’ preference for hypothetical candidates promising to address the issue featured in the drama, and all four dramas elevated the perception that the issue represents a top priority for the community. Pooling across studies (N = 4,504), the effects of narrative messages on voting and prioritization persist more than 16 months after the audio screening and spill over to the spouses of audio screening attendees. </p>

		<details> <summary>Abstract</summary>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">  Narrative entertainment has attracted increasing attention from social scientists and policymakers. One strand of research seeks to understand whether the entertainment that audiences consume in everyday life affects their beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors; another, whether purpose-built narrative media campaigns hold promise as a means of addressing social, economic, and political problems. Building on previous literature reviews, we present the results of a meta-analysis of 377 findings from 77 experiments that assess the persuasive effects of narrative radio, TV, and film programs, including a recent wave of studies in low- and middle-income countries. We apply a hierarchical-effects model to studies evaluating narrative media effects across a range of settings and issue domains. The results suggest that narrative entertainment is quite influential, with sizable persuasive effects that remain apparent weeks after initial exposure. A smaller literature reports head-to-head tests of the relative effectiveness of narrative versus non-narrative messages; although inconclusive, the evidence suggests that narratives may be only slightly more persuasive than non-narrative messages. If true, this finding would imply that the main advantage of narratives may be their ability to attract and engage large audiences. We conclude by calling attention to gaps in the literature and proposing avenues for further research. </p>

		<details> <summary>Abstract</summary>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">  Nearly 1 in 3 women worldwide have experienced physical and/or sexual violence, and still its prevalence is widely believed to be underestimated. While previous research focuses on Intimate Partner Violence, this paper shifts the attention to violence outside of the household. We provide one of the first detailed measurement of the perception of the risk that women face in public spaces in Sub-Saharian Africa, and of communities' intent to mobilize against perpetrators. Can media increase awareness of such risks and help prioritize GBV as a societal issue? Through a field experiment across 34 villages in rural Tanzania, we show that a locally-tailored radio soap-opera has the capacity to do so, and that its effects decay but are still detectable more than a year later. Moreover, we show how these changes spillover from audience members to their spouses and teenage children, magnifying the total effect of this easily scalable intervention. </p>

		<details> <summary>Abstract</summary>
		<p style="text-align:justify;">  Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change, yet voters in the region rarely prioritize environmental protection at the ballot box. Can media campaigns raise the political salience of environmental issues? We report the results of a placebo-controlled experiment conducted in Tanzania in which 1,360 respondents from 34 villages were randomly assigned to attend a screening of a radio drama designed to generate support for environmentalism. The drama follows rural villagers as they campaign against a corrupt bargain between developers and a public official to exploit the community's resources. Outcomes were assessed through a survey conducted one month later. Participants who were randomly exposed to the drama became more knowledgeable about climate change, more likely to cite environmental protection as a political priority, and more supportive of pro-environmental policies and candidates. A year later, treatment effects remain detectable for certain measures but decay for others, highlighting the importance of sustained messaging. </p>
